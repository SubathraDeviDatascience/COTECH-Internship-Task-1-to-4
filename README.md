## Task1 - Decision Tree Implementation
### Overview
  The decision tree model is trained to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The repository includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
Each sample has four features:
 - Sepal length (cm)
 - Sepal width (cm)
 - Petal length (cm)
 - Petal width (cm)

### Conclusion
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for demonstrating classification algorithms and is used here to illustrate the process of training and evaluating a decision tree model.
