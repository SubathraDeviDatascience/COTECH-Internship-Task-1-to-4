## Task1 - Decision Tree Implementation
### Overview
  The decision tree model is trained to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The repository includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
Each sample has four features:
 - Sepal length (cm)
 - Sepal width (cm)
 - Petal length (cm)
 - Petal width (cm)

### Conclusion
  The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for demonstrating classification algorithms and is used here to illustrate the process of training and evaluating a decision tree model.

## Task2 - Sentiment Analysis With NLP
### Overview
  The sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is built to classify customer reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. We use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features and logistic regression for classification. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. Each review is labeled as either 'positive' or 'negative'.
