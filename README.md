## Task1 - Decision Tree Implementation
### Overview
  The decision tree model is trained to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The repository includes code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
### Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
Each sample has four features:
 - Sepal length (cm)
 - Sepal width (cm)
 - Petal length (cm)
 - Petal width (cm)

### Conclusion
  The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for demonstrating classification algorithms and is used here to illustrate the process of training and evaluating a decision tree model.

## Task2 - Sentiment Analysis With NLP
### Overview
  The sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is built to classify customer reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. We use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features and logistic regression for classification. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer reviews with corresponding sentiment labels. Each review is labeled as either 'positive' or 'negative'.

### Conculsion
  This project demonstrates the effective use of TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression for sentiment analysis on customer reviews, achieving high accuracy. The approach provides a versatile solution for various text classification tasks.

## Task3 - Image Classification Model
### Overview
  This repository demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 different categories.
### Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for this project. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Classes in CIFAR-10:

 - Airplane
 - Automobile
 - Bird
 - Cat
 - Deer
 - Dog
 - Frog
 - Horse
 - Ship
 - Truck

The dataset is preloaded in TensorFlow, making it easy to use for training and evaluation.
